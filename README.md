# Purpose
The purpose of the wepage is to display my work in an organized and easy to read fashion for future employers.

#My Experience 
My experience creating this webpage was very interesting. I was able to learn and use the code I learned in class as well as go back and debug problems as they occured. Overall I learned that there are many different things I could do with HTML and CSS.
